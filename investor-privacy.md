# Privacy Policy for INVESTOR

**Effective Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026

**INVESTOR** ("we", "us", or "our") is a personal side project mobile application developed by Ankit Priyadarshi for tracking and analyzing your own investment portfolio using AI-powered insights.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights. Because this is an indie/side-project app with **minimal data collection** and **no central server storing your personal portfolio data**, our practices are intentionally simple and privacy-focused.

By using INVESTOR, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect only the minimum information necessary for the app to function:

- **Information You Provide Directly**  
  - Portfolio and investment data you manually enter or import (e.g., stock tickers like AAPL/AMZN/TSM, real estate holdings, silver futures positions, bank balances, values, and notes).  
  - This data is stored **locally on your device** only.

- **Automatically Collected Device & Usage Information**  
  - Basic device details (e.g., device model, operating system version, screen size).  
  - App usage data (e.g., timestamps of interactions, feature usage — fully anonymized and local).  
  - No precise location, contacts, camera, microphone, or other sensitive permissions are required or collected.

We do **not** collect:
- Your name, email address, phone number, or any account login credentials (no user accounts exist).
- Payment information or financial credentials.
- Any data from third-party sources without your explicit action.

All data stays on **your device**. No portfolio or personal investment details are transmitted to us or any server.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information **only** to:
- Provide core app functionality: display, calculate, analyze, and visualize your entered portfolio data.
- Generate local AI-powered insights, suggestions, and chat responses based solely on your on-device data.
- Improve the app experience through anonymous, aggregated, local usage patterns (never linked to you personally).

We do **not** use your data for marketing, advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to operating the app.

## 3. Sharing & Disclosure of Information

We do **not** share, sell, rent, or disclose your personal or portfolio information to any third parties.

- No data leaves your device except when you choose to export/share screenshots or data manually.
- If the app uses any third-party libraries/SDKs (e.g., for charts, local AI models, or crash reporting), they process only anonymized technical data and are bound by their own privacy policies — we do not send your investment details to them.

We may disclose information only if required by law (e.g., court order) or to protect our rights.

## 4. Data Storage & Security

- All your portfolio data is stored **locally on your device** using standard secure storage mechanisms provided by iOS/Android.
- We implement reasonable technical measures (e.g., avoiding unnecessary data exposure in memory) to protect your information.
- However, no electronic storage or local processing is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, and you use the app at your own risk.

We do not control your device's security (e.g., if your phone is lost, unlocked, or compromised).

## 5. Your Rights & Choices

You have full control over your data because it never leaves your device:
- **Access** — View all your entered data directly in the app (Holdings screen).
- **Correct** — Edit or update any entry at any time.
- **Delete** — Remove individual holdings or reset/clear all data via app settings or by uninstalling.
- **Export** — Manually screenshot or copy data if needed (no automated export of sensitive data).

No "account deletion" is needed since no accounts exist.

## 6. Children's Privacy

INVESTOR is not directed to children under 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 7. International Users & Compliance

This app is operated from [your country, e.g., India]. Your data remains on your device regardless of location.

We aim to comply with applicable privacy laws (including GDPR principles for transparency and minimal processing where relevant), but as a small side project with no central data storage, many obligations do not apply.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy occasionally (e.g., if app features change). We will post the new version here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.
